Description of NewtonRaphsonExamples repository:

The cpp files contain implementations of different methods for computing what
are known as 'tangent-stiffness' matrices in computational mechanics or
'Jacobian' matrices in mathematics.

These examples are not general purpose, but give an idea of how to use each
Jacobian calculation method in solving a nonlinear system within the
Newton-Raphson method.

Included in the examples is a method using forward difference, which is one
type of finite difference, a method using automatic differentiation, which is a
computerized implementation of the chain rule of calculus, and complex step,
which is a method for calculating a Jacobian based on complex Taylor series
expansion.

All three examples were written and tested on a system running
Ubuntu Linux 13.04 64bit with GCC 4.7 for compiler.

Used Trilinos API with Teuchos and Sacado packages, available at
trilinos.sandia.gov.

Requires Teuchos be compiled with complex number support.

NOTES:

24 AUG. 2013: Michael: 
Completed removing dependency on Armadillo API. Fixed
error calculation mistakes. AD example accuracy somehow below that of the other
two examples.
